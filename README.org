* RedBaron4emacs

Tests for python code manipulation (without rope).

** Motivation

take the  string =def  foo(first, **kwargs, second=foo):  pass=, where
the arguments are in a bad order, and sort them:

: def foo(first, second=foo, **kwargs): pass

Call that from within emacs, use with my snippet to add an argument to
a function, and it becomes a bit simpler (no more movements around the
code) and smarter (we manipulate =code=, not text with clunky regexps)
to add an argument to a method.
